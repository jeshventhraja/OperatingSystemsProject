<h1>Page Replacement Algorithms</h1>
<p>
Page replacement takes the following approach. If no frame is free, we find
one that is not currently being used and free it. We can free a frame by writing
its contents to swap space and changing the page table (and all other tables) to
indicate that the page is no longer in memory. We can now use
the freed frame to hold the page for which the process faulted. We modify the
page-fault service routine to include page replacement:</br>

1. Find the location of the desired page on the disk.</br>
2. Find a free frame:</br>
<ul>
<li>If there is a free frame, use it.</li></br>
<li>If there is no free frame, use a page-replacement algorithm to select
a victim frame.</li></br>
<li>Write the victim frame to the disk; change the page and frame tables
accordingly.</li></br>
</ul>
3. Read the desired page into the newly freed frame; change the page and
frame tables.</br>
4. Continue the user process from where the page fault occurred.</br></br>
Notice that, if no frames are free, two page transfers (one out and one in)
are required. This situation effectively doubles the page-fault service time and
increases the effective access time accordingly.</br></br>

<h4>FIFO</h4>
The simplest page-replacement algorithm is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) algorithm.
A FIFO replacement algorithm associates with each page the time when that
page was brought into memory. When a page must be replaced, the oldest
page is chosen. Notice that it is not strictly necessary to record the time when
a page is brought in. We can create a FIFO queue to hold all pages in memory.
We replace the page at the head of the queue. When a page is brought into
memory, we insert it at the tail of the queue.</br></br>

The FIFO page-replacement algorithm is easy to understand and program.
However, its performance is not always good. On the one hand, the page
replaced may be an initialization module that was used a long time ago and is
no longer needed. On the other hand, it could contain a heavily used variable
that was initialized early and is in constant use.</br></br>

Even if we select for replacement a page that is in active use,
everything still works correctly. After we replace an active page with a new
one, a fault occurs almost immediately to retrieve the active page. Some other
page must be replaced to bring the active page back into memory. Thus, a bad
replacement choice increases the page-fault rate and slows process execution.
It does not, however, cause incorrect execution.</br>

<h4>OPR</h4>

One result of the discovery of Belady’s anomaly was the search for an optimal
page-replacement algorithm—the algorithm that has the lowest page-fault
rate of all algorithms and will never suffer from Belady’s anomaly. Such an
algorithm does exist and has been called OPT or MIN. It is simply this:
Replace the page that will not be used for the longest period of time.
Use of this page-replacement algorithm guarantees the lowest possible pagefault
rate for a fixed number of frames.</br></br>

Unfortunately, the optimal page-replacement algorithm is difficult to
implement, because it requires future knowledge of the reference string. </br>



<h4>LRU Page Replacement</h4>
If the optimal algorithm is not feasible, perhaps an approximation of the
optimal algorithm is possible. The key distinction between the FIFO and OPT
algorithms (other than looking backward versus forward in time) is that the
FIFO algorithm uses the time when a page was brought into memory, whereas
the OPT algorithm uses the time when a page is to be used. If we use the recent
past as an approximation of the near future, then we can replace the page that
has not been used for the longest period of time. This approach is the least
recently used (LRU) algorithm.</br></br>
LRU replacement associates with each page the time of that page’s last use.
When a page must be replaced, LRU chooses the page that has not been used
for the longest period of time.</br>









<h4>LRU-Approximation Page Replacement</h4>

<h4>1 Additional-Reference-Bits Algorithm</h4>

We can gain additional ordering information by recording the reference bits at
regular intervals.We can keep an 8-bit byte for each page in a table in memory.
At regular intervals (say, every 100 milliseconds), a timer interrupt transfers
control to the operating system. The operating system shifts the reference bit
for each page into the high-order bit of its 8-bit byte, shifting the other bits right
by 1 bit and discarding the low-order bit. These 8-bit shift registers contain the
history of page use for the last eight time periods. If the shift register contains
00000000, for example, then the page has not been used for eight time periods.
A page that is used at least once in each period has a shift register value of
11111111. A page with a history register value of 11000100 has been used more
recently than one with a value of 01110111. If we interpret these 8-bit bytes
as unsigned integers, the page with the lowest number is the LRU page, and
it can be replaced. Notice that the numbers are not guaranteed to be unique,
however.We can either replace (swap out) all pages with the smallest value or
use the FIFO method to choose among them.</br></br>
The number of bits of history included in the shift register can be varied,
of course, and is selected (depending on the hardware available) to make
the updating as fast as possible. In the extreme case, the number can be
reduced to zero, leaving only the reference bit itself. This algorithm is called
the second-chance page-replacement algorithm.</br>


<h4>2 Second-Chance Algorithm</h4>
The basic algorithm of second-chance replacement is a FIFO replacement
algorithm. When a page has been selected, however, we inspect its reference
bit. If the value is 0, we proceed to replace this page; but if the reference bit
is set to 1, we give the page a second chance and move on to select the next
FIFO page. When a page gets a second chance, its reference bit is cleared, and
its arrival time is reset to the current time. Thus, a page that is given a second
chance will not be replaced until all other pages have been replaced (or given second chances). In addition, if a page is used often enough to keep its reference
bit set, it will never be replaced.</br></br>
One way to implement the second-chance algorithm (sometimes referred
to as the clock algorithm) is as a circular queue. A pointer (that is, a hand on
the clock) indicates which page is to be replaced next. When a frame is needed,
the pointer advances until it finds a page with a 0 reference bit. As it advances,
it clears the reference bits (Figure 9.17). Once a victim page is found, the page
is replaced, and the new page is inserted in the circular queue in that position.
Notice that, in the worst case, when all bits are set, the pointer cycles through
the whole queue, giving each page a second chance. It clears all the reference
bits before selecting the next page for replacement. Second-chance replacement
degenerates to FIFO replacement if all bits are set.</br>


<h4>3 Enhanced Second-Chance Algorithm</h4>


We can enhance the second-chance algorithm by considering the reference bit
and the modify bit as an ordered pair. With these
two bits, we have the following four possible classes:</br>
1. (0, 0) neither recently used nor modified-best page to replace</br>
2. (0, 1) not recently used but modified-not quite as good, because the
page will need to be written out before replacement.</br>
3. (1, 0) recently used but clean-probably will be used again soon</br>
4. (1, 1) recently used and modified-probably will be used again soon, and
the page will be need to be written out to disk before it can be replaced</br></br>
Each page is in one of these four classes. When page replacement is called for,
we use the same scheme as in the clock algorithm; but instead of examining
whether the page to which we are pointing has the reference bit set to 1,
we examine the class to which that page belongs. We replace the first page
encountered in the lowest nonempty class. Notice that we may have to scan
the circular queue several times before we find a page to be replaced.
The major difference between this algorithm and the simpler clock algorithm
is that here we give preference to those pages that have been modified
in order to reduce the number of I/Os required.</br>


<h4>Counting-Based Page Replacement</h4>

There are many other algorithms that can be used for page replacement. For
example, we can keep a counter of the number of references that have been
made to each page and develop the following two schemes.</br>
<ul>
<li>The least frequently used (LFU) page-replacement algorithm requires that
the page with the smallest count be replaced. The reason for this selection is
that an actively used page should have a large reference count. A problem
arises, however, when a page is used heavily during the initial phase of
a process but then is never used again. Since it was used heavily, it has a
large count and remains in memory even though it is no longer needed.
One solution is to shift the counts right by 1 bit at regular intervals, forming
an exponentially decaying average usage count.</li></br>
<li>The most frequently used (MFU) page-replacement algorithm is based
on the argument that the page with the smallest count was probably just
brought in and has yet to be used.</li>
</ul>
