<h1>Sleeping Barber's Problem</h1>
<p>
There is one barber in the barber shop, one barber chair and n chairs for waiting customers. If there are no customers, the barber sits down in the barber chair and takes a nap. An arriving customer must wake the barber. Subsequent arriving customers take a waiting chair if any are empty or leave if all chairs are full. This problem addresses race conditions. </br></br>
This solution uses three semaphores-</br>
<ol>
<li>custReady-To indicate if a customer is ready or not.</li>
<li>accessSeats-This gives mutual exclusion while accessing the seat count variable.</li>
<li>barbReady-This indicates if the barber is ready.</li> 
</ol>
