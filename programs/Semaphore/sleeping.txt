<b>Sleeping Barber Problem</b>
There is one barber in the barber shop, one barber chair and n chairs for waiting customers. If there are no customers, the barber sits down in the barber chair and takes a nap. An arriving customer must wake the barber. Subsequent arriving customers take a waiting chair if any are empty or leave if all chairs are full. This problem addresses race conditions. 
This solution uses three semaphores-
1)custReady-To indicate if a customer is ready or not.
2)accessSeats-This gives mutual exclusion while accessing the seat count variable.
3)barbReady-This indicates if the barber is ready.
