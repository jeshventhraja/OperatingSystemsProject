<body><hr><p> <p>  <b>PROCESS CONTROL</b> :
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  A running program needs to be able to stop execution either normally or abnormally.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  When execution is stopped abnormally, often a dump of memory is taken and can be examined with a debugger
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p> 
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p> <b> File Management</b> :
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  Some common system calls are create, delete, read, write, reposition, or close. 
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  Also, there is a need to determine the file attributes  get and set file attribute.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p> 
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  <b>Device Management</b> :
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  Process usually require several resources to execute, if these resources are available, they will be granted and control returned to the user process. 
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  These resources are also thought of as devices. Some are physical, such as a video card, and others are abstract, such as a file.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  User programs request the device, and when finished they release the device. Similar to files, we can read, write, and reposition the device.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p> 
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  <b>Information Management </b>:
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  Some system calls exist purely for transferring information between the user program and the operating system. An example of this is time, or date.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  The OS also keeps information about all its processes and provides system calls to report this information.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p> 
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  <b>Communication </b>:
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  There are two models of interprocess communication, the message-passing model and the shared memory model.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  Message-passing uses a common mailbox to pass messages between processes.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  Shared memory use certain system calls to create and gain access to create and gain access to regions of memory owned by other processes.
 </p><br></font></p><hr><p> <p>  The two processes exchange information by reading and writing in the shared data.
