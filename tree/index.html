<h1>Tree Directory Structure</h1>
<p>A tree is the most common directory structure. The tree has a root directory, and every file in the
system has a unique path name.</br></br>

A directory (or subdirectory) contains a set of files or subdirectories. A
directory is simply another file, but it is treated in a special way. All directories
have the same internal format. One bit in each directory entry defines the entry
as a file (0) or as a subdirectory (1). Special system calls are used to create and
delete directories.
</br></br>
In normal use, each process has a current directory. The current directory 
should contain most of the files that are of current interest to the process.
When reference is made to a file, the current directory is searched. If a file
is needed that is not in the current directory, then the user usually must either specify a path name or change the current directory to be the directory
holding that file.</p>
